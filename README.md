Bootstrap portfolio project. 

This project consisted of using the bootstrap library to create specific styling for a personalized webpage. This webpage consists of 3 forms that are reactive as well as optimized for mobile users. When the screen size shrinks, the navbar moves into a functional toggler. All of the content on the webpage is fully responsive. 

The index file contains information about myself as well as an image. 

The portfolio file contains empty placeholders where I can eventually add projects to display.

The contact file contains a form that can be submitted for contacting me. This is currently non-functional but could be supported in the future.
